R3V3RS3 IT is a web game in 10kb that I made for fun and to do some reasearch on new techniques for Clockwork Chilli's upcoming projects. I submitted it to the js13k competition 2015 (http://js13kgames.com)

"In 10 kb" means that the whole game fits in a 10kb zip (10.4 to be precise). There is only one index.html and no resources are downloaded from the net. Just a bit of JavaScript, CSS and HTML to generate everything.

Feel free to reusue some of this stuff for your own web games.
